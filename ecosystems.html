      <h3>Why learning about ecosystems is useful?</h3>

      <p>
        Cause you will start to see the world as a connected system with all
        it's different and important parts. You understand why different
        ecosystems are where they are geographically and how they affect each
        other and
        <em>us</em> as well. Once you know the beauty of our planet you can no
        longer ignore the destruction our blind approach usually bring to it.
